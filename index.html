           <b>My name is Stephen and I enjoy playing football, I support Chelsea Football Club and started to support them when I was 5 years old.
		    Here is a link to the clubs website to find out more information about them! <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en">https://www.chelseafc.com/en.</a>
		    I used to play football a lot when I was younger but with school I had to give it up unfortunately due to all the study I had to do. I
		    also enjoy reading and gaming and like to do both whenever I get the free time to do so, I also work part time so that can make it hard
		    to enjoy them as I dont have that much free time. I also really enjoy music and like to listen to a wide variety of different genres of
		    music. I like going to concerts and festivals and hope to go to many more in the future when they start up again. I study at Tu Dublin
		    and have started first year. I'm hoping that in second year I will be able to attend lectures and labs and won't have to be at home doing
 it all online.</b>
